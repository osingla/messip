		The game of Reversi is a two players game. <br>
		The game is played on an 8x8 board. <br>
		The pawns are black on one side (i.e. belongs to one player), and white on the opposite side (i.e. belongs to the other player). <br>
		The goal of the game is to have more pawns belonging to his color, at the end of the game. <br>
 		<br>
		Starting the game, each player chooses a color, either black or white. The player who owns the black plays first. <br>
		<br>

		Each player takes one pawn from the initial pool of 60 pawns and places it on a free cell of the board, the pawn showing the color of the player. <br>
		The new pawns must reverse at least one pawn of the color of the opponent. The new pawn must constitute a 'claw' between it and at least one pawn of the same color, with pawn(s) of the opponent's color, horizontally, vertically or in diagonal. <br>
 		<br>
		Let's take an example: <br>
